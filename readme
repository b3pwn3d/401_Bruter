A robust **HTTP Basic Authentication checker** that validates username/password combinations against multiple URLs concurrently — with built-in retry, timeout, SSL, and error protection mechanisms.

This tool is useful for **auditing or verifying Basic Auth credentials** across many endpoints, while minimizing service overload or lockouts due to network errors or rate limits.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Concurrent URL testing (multi-threaded)  
✅ Retry & exponential backoff system  
✅ Skips URLs after too many consecutive errors  
✅ Optional TLS certificate verification  
✅ Graceful handling of SSL, timeout, and connection errors  
✅ Option to stop once the first valid credential per URL is found  
✅ Safe output logging of valid credentials
